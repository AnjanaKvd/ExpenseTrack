Don't try to build everything at once. A phased, iterative approach is best. This is the **Lean Startup / Agile** methodology.

**Step 1: Finalize the "Paper" Plan (1-2 Weeks)**

- **Action:** Solidify all the logic we've discussed. Create user flow diagrams for every scenario (onboarding, sharing, disputing, resetting).
    
- **Goal:** Have a complete blueprint before writing any code. This saves massive amounts of time later.
    

**Step 2: Build the Core MVP (Minimum Viable Product) (4-6 Weeks)**

- **Focus:** **Phase 1 ONLY.** Get the WhatsApp bot working with the most basic features.
    
- **MVP Feature List:**
    
    1. User Onboarding (Accept T&Cs).
        
    2. Add custom items to track.
        
    3. Log a **personal** expense via a command.
        
    4. Log a **shared** expense against a simple text "Entity" (e.g., "Kamal").
        
    5. A command to view your total share with an Entity.
        
- **What to SKIP for now:** Real user linking, the `[True]/[False]` buttons, the Trust Score, and all AI features.
    
- **Goal:** Create the simplest possible version to prove people will use it.
    

**Step 3: Private Beta Testing (2-3 Weeks)**

- **Action:** Onboard 10-20 friends. Let them use the MVP. Get their raw, honest feedback.
    
- **Goal:** Find out what's confusing, what's missing, and if the core idea is engaging. This feedback is more valuable than gold.
    

**Step 4: Iterate and Add the "Magic" (4-8 Weeks)**

- **Action:** Based on beta feedback, start building the features that make your app unique.
    
- **Priority Order:**
    
    1. Implement the full "Linked Relationship" system.
        
    2. Introduce the `[True]/[False]` confirmation buttons.
        
    3. Build and release the **Trust Score** mechanic.
        
    4. Introduce the `reset` and `disable` relationship commands.
        
- **Goal:** Evolve the working MVP into the compelling social finance tool you envision.
    

**Step 5: Introduce NLP (Phase 2)**

- **Action:** Once the core system is stable and people are using it, begin integrating an NLP service (like Dialogflow) to make the input process more natural. Start with text messages, then add the Speech-to-Text for voice notes.
    
- **Goal:** Reduce friction and make the app a delight to use.
    

**Step 6: Develop the Mobile App (Phase 3)**

- **Action:** **Only after** you have a validated, working product with a growing user base on WhatsApp should you start building the mobile app.
    
- **Reasoning:** The app is a massive investment. By this stage, you have proven the market need, reducing your risk significantly. Your existing WhatsApp users will be your first app downloads.
