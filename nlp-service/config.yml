# NLU Pipeline Configuration
# This pipeline is designed for robust intent classification and entity extraction,
# leveraging both traditional NLP features and deep learning.
pipeline:
  # 1. SpaCy Integration for powerful linguistic features
  - name: SpacyNLP
    model: "en_core_web_md" # Use a medium-sized English model for good balance of speed and accuracy
    case_sensitive: false

  # 2. Tokenizer
  - name: SpacyTokenizer

  # 3. Featurizers - These components create the features the model learns from
  - name: SpacyFeaturizer
    pooling: "mean"

  - name: RegexFeaturizer

  - name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer

  - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer

  - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
    analyzer: "char_wb"
    min_ngram: 1
    max_ngram: 4

  # 4. The main classifier for intents and entities
  - name: DIETClassifier
    epochs: 100
    constrain_similarities: true

  # 5. Post-processing
  - name: EntitySynonymMapper

# Configuration for Rasa Core (Dialogue Management).
# We are only training the NLU, so we can leave this commented out for now.
