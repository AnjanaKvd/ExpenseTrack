👋 Welcome to TrustLedger!

I'm your personal bot to help you track your daily and shared expenses.

Here's how it works:
1️⃣ Add items you want to track (e.g., "add item: Coffee").
2️⃣ Log expenses using simple messages (e.g., "spent 150 on lunch").
3️⃣ Share expenses with friends (e.g., "shared a 300 taxi with Kamal").

By continuing, you accept our Terms & Conditions. Let's get started!
💥 Send yes to begin!

You can start by adding an item to track, like this:

Or log your first expense:
